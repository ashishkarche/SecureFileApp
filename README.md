3. `Multiparty Method` -

### Multiparty encryption with FHE -

Encrypted data can be stored safely or transferred to a third party for analysis. Depending on the type of homomorphic encryption, certain processes are possible.

##### ` Fully homomorphic encryption`: With this method of encryption, more than one type of secure computation can be performed. Additionally, there is no limit to the number of operations that can be performed.
